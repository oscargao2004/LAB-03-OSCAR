Group members: David Chuong and Oscar Gao will both fill the same role of programmer.

Each member should contribute roughly 50% of the total work done in this project. Doing one design pattern from each category/section. In the case of one member doing more work than the other, the other member will need to try and catch up by doing more work to maintain the 50/50 division of work. Otherwise the contribution percentage will drop by 5-10% for each time this happens. (Severity will differ case by case)

If one member feels that the other isn't doing enough work, they should talk about to the other member about this and come to a conclusion. If no conclusion is reached, the party doing more work may inform the course professor and/or TA. Final contribution totals will be written and explained when submitting the project.

These are what will potentially be done for design patterns and are not a final statement on what will be included in the final build. The listed implementations may not be present due to it not being required or us not having the resources to implement them such as running out of time. 
The use of Singletons will be in the form of a Game, Save, UI, Input, Audio and/or ResourceManager.
For now we will be focusing on a GameManager and UIManager.

The Command design pattern will be in the form of custom button mapping, unique banner/profile pic/character customization and/or world editing.
For now we will be focusing on custom button mapping and customization for a banner/profile pic/character/tower.

The Factory pattern will be in the form of UI creation, Audio management, scene population and/or terrain creation.
For now we will be focusing on UI creation and scene population. 

The Observer pattern will be in the form of Achievements, UI/HUD updates, SFX/Music triggers, and/or Health monitoring.
For now we will be focusing on UI/HUD updates and Health monitoring for the Observer pattern.

This project will be a tower defense game where players must place towers to defeat the predetermined waves of enemies before they reach the end of their path. 
This project will show to whomever is concerned, that we understand the concepts of design patterns and implement them into our game. Players will be able to play the first (and only) level and survive to the end.
